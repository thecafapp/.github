## The Caf App üç¥

#### About the app
The Caf App started at Mississippi College in 2022 as a side project from Micah Lindley, a computer science student who wanted to improve the way students accessed the cafeteria menu.  Over the next year, flagship features like ratings, profiles, data history, and much more were added to the app.  The Caf App became available to other schools in 2024.

#### For students
The Caf App provides an easy-to-use, comprehensive interface for students to view meal hours, see menus, rate their experiences, find other dining on campus, and much more.

#### For administrators
Advanced statistical dashboards and access to raw meal and rating data allows administrators to make informed decisions regarding their campus‚Äô food service experience.
